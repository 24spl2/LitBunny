# LitBunny
LitBunny~figuratively and literally~

This was a lab in 371 Computer Graphics with Prof. Jim Bern

Blinn-Phong lighting was made around the 70s when Phong discovered that there were only 3 compenents to make a figure look realistically light.
Those 3 being (1) Ambient (2) Diffuse (3) Specular.


Ambient lighting is acheived by block shading the figure by a darker version of that color. This is easily achieved by reducing the color of draw by say ~*.5

Diffuse lighting is when the normals of the figure interact with the location of the light. For example, the half of the bunny closer to the light will be more bright

Specular lighting is more complicated, since you have to take in account the viewer's eye. Specular lighting happens when the light source bounces on the bunny, and reflects directly into the viewers eye.


Together a really cool effect is made! Reproducing historical code is a very fascinating way to be in the footseps of famous coders!
